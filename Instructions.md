Disclaimer: Hak5 (the creators of the WiFi pineapple) are a hardware company. They have their own proprietary firmware but the software is open source, and largely based on other people’s open source tools. Thus, we can bring our own hardware, use OpenWrt as our firmware and port Hak5’s software without stepping on any toes. 

<h3>Equipment:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>GL-MT300N-V2, aka the Mango (or another compatible router from here: https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-cloner/blob/master/devices.md)</li>
    <li>USB A hub – at least three extra ports</li>
    <li>USB flash drive</li>
    <li>2 USB antennas with compatible WiFi chipsets (listed here: https://github.com/SHUR1K-N/wifi-mangoapple-resources#chipsets , I used chipset RT5572)</li>
    <li>a device with an Ethernet port (for sshing into the Mango)</li>
    <li>(optional) a portable power source, otherwise you can just plug it into your computer to power it</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start by connecting you USB flash drive and your antennas to the hub. Make note of which component is in each port as this needs to remain consistent throughout usage.</l1>
